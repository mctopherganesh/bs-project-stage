# Blood Sugar Tracking Project

Welcome to my blood sugar tracking project. When I first started tracking my blood sugar I only had this little monitor that I would have to go through measure by measure to see all my recordings and the only metric it could give me was my average.

That is **definitely** not enough data!

I wanted to make something that I could input my blood sugar measure into and get immediate feedback, as in graphs and such.

I used Discord to create a bot that would respond to specific commands and had built in functions I could call to get data about my blood sugar. Here's a video because showing is better than telling:

Let me know what you think!
